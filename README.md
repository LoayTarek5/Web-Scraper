# Java Web Scraper Project

## Overview

This is a robust and flexible web scraping application designed to extract data from websites efficiently and reliably. The project provides a comprehensive set of tools for web scraping, including concurrent processing, rate limiting, error handling, and detailed statistics tracking.

## Features

### 1. Concurrent Web Scraping
- Multi-threaded scraping with configurable thread count
- Efficient task management using `ExecutorService`
- Supports processing multiple URLs simultaneously

### 2. Advanced Data Processing
- Flexible `DataProcessor` for transforming and sanitizing scraped content
- Metadata extraction and storage
- Content filtering and sanitization options

### 3. Robust Error Handling
- Retry mechanism for failed scrapes
- Detailed error tracking and categorization
- Exponential backoff for retry attempts

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Prevents overwhelming target websites
- Configurable delay between requests
- Domain-based access tracking

### 5. Comprehensive Statistics
- Track successful and failed scrapes
- Monitor processing times
- Collect domain-specific statistics
- Generate detailed scraping reports

## Key Components

### `WebScraper`
- Main scraping engine
- Manages URL queue and concurrent processing
- Supports custom configuration via builder pattern

### `ScraperWorker`
- Individual worker for scraping a single URL
- Handles retry logic
- Extracts metadata and content

### `DataProcessor`
- Processes and transforms scraped data
- Applies content filters
- Supports listener pattern for custom processing

### `ScraperStats`
- Tracks and analyzes scraping performance
- Generates detailed statistical reports
- Monitors error types, content types, and domain performance

### `ScrapeData`
- Represents scraped data from a single URL
- Stores content, metadata, and processing information
- Supports builder pattern for flexible object creation

## Example Usage

```java
// Create a WebScraper with custom configuration
WebScraper scraper = WebScraper.builder()
    .threadCount(4)
    .timeout(15000)
    .delayBetweenRequests(1000)
    .build();

// Add URLs to scrape
scraper.addUrl("http://books.toscrape.com/");
scraper.start();

// Get scraping results
List<ScrapeData> results = scraper.getResults();
```

## Installation Requirements

- Java 17+
- Maven or Gradle
- Dependencies:
  - Jsoup (HTML parsing)
  - SLF4J (Logging)
  - Lombok (Optional, for reducing boilerplate code)

## Configuration Options

- Thread count
- Request timeout
- Delay between requests
- Content filtering
- Metadata extraction

## Logging

The project uses SLF4J for logging, providing detailed insights into the scraping process.

## Error Handling

- Automatic retry mechanism
- Detailed error categorization
- Configurable retry count and backoff strategy

## Performance Considerations

- Concurrent processing
- Rate limiting to prevent IP blocking
- Efficient memory management
- Configurable thread pool

## Security and Ethics

- Respect `robots.txt`
- Implement reasonable request delays
- Use appropriate user agents
- Obtain necessary permissions before scraping

## Potential Improvements

- Add support for proxy rotation
- Implement more advanced content extraction
- Create more sophisticated rate limiting
- Add support for authentication
- Enhance error recovery mechanisms

## Disclaimer

Web scraping may be subject to legal and ethical constraints. Always ensure you have the right to scrape a website and comply with the site's terms of service.
